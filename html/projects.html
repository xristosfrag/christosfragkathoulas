                    href="https://www.cse.uoi.gr/teams/%CF%80%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%AC-%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1/"
                    class="links">Prof. Evagelia Pitoura</a> on applying machine learning techniques to relational data and creating embeddings using a novel method. The process involved creating a set of edges based on the relationships between different entities in the data, which were then used to build a graph. Random walks were applied to the graph to generate sentences, which served as the input for training the embeddings. To achieve a more complete representation of the neighbors of each node, the system utilized the innovative approach of promoting random walks as the propositions for learning, rather than encoding a line of the data set. For the training of the embeddings, I implemented and compared several popular learning algorithms and all of their variations, using different values for the model parameters, such as window size and dimensions, were tested to determine the optimal settings for each algorithm. I finally evaluated these embeddings by comparing their quality and time performance under different conditions. The results were used to identify the most effective algorithms and parameter values for generating high-quality embeddings.
